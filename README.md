# happy_birthday
Send a tweet wishing a notable person happy birthday

Simple script written to tweet 'Happy Birthday' to a random person from the current dates Wikipedia page birth section. Originally made for a first year CompSci assignment.

Written circa 2020 and not updated since - Twitter API changes likely to have broken it.
